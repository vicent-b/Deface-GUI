# Deface-GUI
This projet is a GUI for mdraw's "deface" command line tool with frame-per-frame tools, allowing for automatic and quick face censoring form videos. Frame censoring may be necessary for activities such as transparently sharing video training data for Neural Nets or reporter activity without compromising passerby's privacy
